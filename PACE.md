 Benjamin Franklin once said, "By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail."

A structure for the data workflow is divided into six phases - Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.

PACE

Plan - Define the scope of the project. Identify the informational needs of the organization. Eg: What arethe goals of the project? What strategies will be needed? What will be the business or operational impacts of this plan?

Analyze - Engage with the data by preparing it for the project. Collect necessary data from primary and secondary sources. Then clean, reorganize and transform it for analysis. Also engage in EDA - exploratory data analysis which involves converting the data into usable formats, assessing the quality of the data and work with stakeholders to see which of those areas are worth pursuing in more detail.

Construct - Work with the interesting data in the EDA. Here is when you will work with other data professionals, potentially statisticians and machine-learning engineers to do things like building machine learning models and revising those, uncovering relationships within your data and doing statistical inference about those relationships.

Execute - share the result of your analysis and your collaboration with your stakeholders, as well as the value that you've unlocked from your data. Here you will present findings to internal and external stakeholders, answering questions and considering different viewpoints. You'll also have an opportunity to present recommendations based on what you found in the data. You may discover that you revisit the planning and analysis stages as you refine models and incorporate feedback.
