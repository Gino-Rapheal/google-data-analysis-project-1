RACI matrix #1:
Access to data: Based on their general roles within an organization, the business intelligence engineer, analytics team manager, and data engineer have all been identified as responsible for providing access to the data. The data scientist, who is more responsible for working with the analytics team to draw insights from the data, is just consulted. 

Create models to analyze data: The data scientist, who is primarily concerned with drawing insights from the data, is responsible for this task. The business intelligence engineer and analytics team manager are consulted. The data engineer, who is concerned with infrastructure, is kept informed. 

Drive insights and recommendations based on data: Similarly to the previous task, the data scientist is the primary team member responsible for this task. 

RACI matrix #2: 
Ensure data compliance: Data compliance is part of developing and managing databases, which is the responsibility of the data engineer. Other team members are consulted or informed, but the data engineer is tasked with the actual responsibility of ensuring compliance.

Chief data officer: Although all of the tasks in this project are the direct responsibility of other team members, the company’s chief data officer is accountable for them—meaning this role has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring this task is completed.
